# Project Presentation for Investors

## Introduction
Welcome to the presentation for our innovative project focused on developing a large language model (LLM) and a text-to-speech (TTS) system. Our goal is to create a state-of-the-art TTS system that can generate high-quality voiceovers in the Kikuyu language, providing a valuable tool for content creators, educators, and businesses.

## Project Overview
Our project involves the development of two key components:
1. **Large Language Model (LLM)**: A powerful model trained on a diverse dataset to understand and generate human-like text in the Kikuyu language.
2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) System**: A system that converts written text into natural-sounding speech, specifically tailored for the Kikuyu language.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: PyTorch, Flask, Dash, TTS (Text-to-Speech) library
- **Cloud Services**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) for storage, computation, and deployment
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code management and collaboration

## Architecture
The architecture of our solution consists of the following components:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collecting and preprocessing Kikuyu language data, including text and audio samples.
2. **Model Training**: Training the LLM and TTS models using the preprocessed data.
3. **API Development**: Developing APIs to interact with the trained models and provide TTS services.
4. **Web Application**: Creating a user-friendly web application to allow users to input text and receive voiceovers in the Kikuyu language.

## Benefits and Future Prospects
- **Cultural Preservation**: Promoting the Kikuyu language and making it accessible to a wider audience.
- **Content Creation**: Enabling content creators to produce high-quality voiceovers in Kikuyu.
- **Education**: Providing educational tools for teaching and learning the Kikuyu language.
- **Business Applications**: Offering businesses the ability to create localized content for Kikuyu-speaking audiences.
