# Investor Presentation

## Introduction
The `codekijiji.ai` project is part of an initiative to develop a Language Learning Model (LLM) for Kenyan indigenous languages, with a focus on the Kikuyu language. The project includes a web-based data collection interface for public text and voice submissions.

## Development
The project was developed using React and Chakra UI for a responsive and accessible user interface. Contributions are managed via GitHub with continuous integration/deployment. Recent updates include the integration of a Google Form for partnership inquiries and enhancements to the data analysis script for improved visualization.

## Technical Architecture
The technical architecture of the `codekijiji.ai` project consists of several key components:
- **Frontend**: Built with React and Chakra UI for a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Implemented using Flask and Dash for API services and data visualization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes PyTorch for training and inference of the Language Learning Model (LLM) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) system.
- **Data Storage**: AWS S3 is used for storing training data, model checkpoints, and user submissions.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on AWS EC2 instances with Docker for containerization and ECS for orchestration.

## Value Proposition
The `codekijiji.ai` project aims to preserve and promote Kenyan indigenous languages by providing a platform for language learning and voice synthesis. Key value propositions include:
- **Cultural Preservation**: By digitizing and making indigenous languages accessible, the project helps preserve cultural heritage.
- **Educational Tool**: The platform serves as an educational resource for learning and practicing indigenous languages.
- **Community Engagement**: Encourages community participation in data collection and language preservation efforts.

## Roadmap
The future development roadmap for the `codekijiji.ai` project includes:
- **Model Improvements**: Enhancing the accuracy and performance of the LLM and TTS models.
- **Feature Expansion**: Adding support for more indigenous languages and additional features such as speech recognition.
